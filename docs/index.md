# Complex queries made simple

FunQL .NET is the official .NET implementation of [FunQL](https://funql.io/), the open-source Functional Query Language.
It provides a simple way to add powerful query capabilities to existing REST APIs or build standalone FunQL APIs.

With FunQL .NET, you can:

- **Enhance existing REST APIs** with ready-to-use components for filtering, sorting, pagination, and more.
- **Build standalone FunQL APIs** that harness the full power of the FunQL Query Language.
- **Integrate with LINQ and EF Core** to transform FunQL queries into efficient database queries.

FunQL .NET is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate, giving developers full control over API
behavior without unnecessary complexity. We continuously improve FunQL .NET to support new use cases and enhance
developer experience.

Let's get started with FunQL .NET!
