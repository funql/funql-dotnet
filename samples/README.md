# FunQL .NET Samples

This directory contains a solution with example projects demonstrating how to use FunQL .NET in different scenarios.

- [`Basic`](./Basic) - A minimal, self-contained console application that demonstrates how to configure a FunQL schema,
  use LINQ to apply queries, and filter and sort data using FunQL query parameters.
- [`WebApi`](./WebApi) - A REST API example that integrates FunQL .NET with Entity Framework Core (EF Core), Noda Time,
  System.Text.Json, and minimal APIs.

These examples serve as a starting point for learning how to use FunQL in .NET applications. More samples will be added
over time to cover additional use cases and integrations.
