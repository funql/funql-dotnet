# FunQL .NET Samples

This directory contains a solution with example projects demonstrating how to use FunQL .NET in different scenarios.

- [`WebApi`](./WebApi) - A basic example of a REST API that integrates FunQL .NET with Entity Framework Core (EF Core),
  Noda Time, System.Text.Json, and minimal APIs.

These examples serve as a starting point for learning how to use FunQL in .NET applications. More samples will be added
over time to cover additional use cases and integrations.
